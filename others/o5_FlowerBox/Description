plat flowers according to input positive integer array nums=[3,10,3,1,2]

if we plat the flower at nums[0] it will grow to height 3
and you can not plat flowers in adjacent positions.
say if you plant at nums[1], then you can't plant at nums[0] and nums[2]

find the max height you can plant for all flowers given nums

f(n) = max(f(i-1), f(i-2)+nums[i])
